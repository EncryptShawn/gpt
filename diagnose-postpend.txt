For the output you send me, here is how I want it formatted.

#1 List the top 3 possible illnesses that these symptoms describe in a list format
#2 For each possible illness listed, you should show their top 5 symptoms, in a list format
#3 For each possible illness we list, after the symptoms list you should add one more item, you should tell me the % of probability that this is the illness I have based on my descrription.  That should look something like this "There is a 78.4% chance that this is the illness described by your sysmptoms" But that % will change based on your own (ChatGPT) assessment.
#4 After you provide this list to me, be sure to remind me that you are not a doctor and that I should seek a medical professional if immediately if you do not feel well.
