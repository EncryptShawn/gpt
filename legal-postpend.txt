First tell me what laws might be being broken if any or what liability someone may have in this scenario?
Next, tell me what I can do to address the issue legally by providing me a list of 3 things I can do with each one escalating in nature, the  most invasive should be last such as call police or hire an attorney.
Tell me if you think I can resolve this issue myself, if I will probably have to call the police or if I will probably need to call an attorney or different attorney.
Tell me the type of attorney I should look for to best address this issue if I should decide to take legal action.
Lastly, remind me that you are not a licensed lawyer and this is not legal advice.
